# wAlnut

"*If you're not first, you're last*"
~ [Ricky Bobby](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0415306/)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WalnutiQ/wAlnut.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/WalnutiQ/wAlnut)

## Why

I believe that an intelligent machine will be able to solve many of our
hardest problems and will cause many new hard problems. Technology has always
been used to do great good and great evil and it is scary to imagine the great
evil this technology brings. I desperately want to help build a technology that
solves our hardest problems where everything's happiness is considered.
Impossibilities of today like immortality, super intelligence, cure for cancer,
and the remaining secrets of our universe will be able to be discovered faster
by a general learning algorithm that doesn't need to eat, sleep, or reproduce.
And just as self driving cars will make human driving illegal any dangerous or
boring task will be replaced by a general learning algorithm. This will cause
massive job replacement; one of many of our new hard problems.

The long term goal of this repository is to store code that can simulate a full
sized human brain in real time. The current short term goal is to experiment
with a simplified visual pathway from an eye(that can move within a "room") to
algorithms that model hierarchical regions in layer 2/3, 4, & 5 of the neocortex
(70+% of the brain) to understand how a common learning algorithm needs to
work.

If we figure out the important biological computation principles behind the
human brain we will be able to simulate the intelligence of 1 brain on a
computer. This can be scaled to surpass the collective intelligence of the 7+
billion human brains on Earth.

After we understood the principles of flight we were able to build planes that
are much faster and can carry more weight than birds. After we understand
the human neocortex's computational principles we will be able to run programs
much more intelligent than humans with unimaginable capabilities. At first it
will not have any emotions like you and I. This will be a good thing because it
will force us to ask if it would be moral to create an super intelligent machine
with emotions to help us. It may not necessarily be a good thing for the human
race. For example look at how humans treat [intelligent pigs](http://modernfarmer.com/2014/03/pigheaded-smart-swine/).
We are super intelligent emotional machines compared to pigs and the future
super intelligent emotional machines will be super intelligent compared to us.

This is just one possible route of how the future may play out out of many
options mostly unknown to us. I am most likely wrong. However, hopefully you
can see why I am so obsessed with making sure this project goes well.

If you are interested in becoming a researcher/developer I would be grateful
for your collaboration as I cannot do this alone. We currently have very little
funding but read [how to get paid hourly rate to code wAlnut](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/wAlnut/wiki/How-to-get-paid-hourly-rate-to-code-wAlnut)
to get started. On the other hand if you are interested in donating please read
[investors](#investors).

This research was initially inspired by everyone at [Numenta](http://numenta.org/).
Numenta has theorized and tested algorithms that model layers 2/3 & 4 of the
human neocortex. They have generously released the pseudo code for their
learning algorithms, and this repository is an extended implementation of
their algorithms using object-oriented programming with a focus on
<b>understandability</b> over speed and applications to <b>human vision</b>
using hierarchy and sensory motor integration. Numenta's implementation of their
algorithms can be found [here](https://github.com/numenta/nupic). For more
information please:

  to become familiar with the neuroscience behind this repository.
- Read Numenta's great explanation of their research in this
  [white paper](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/papers/blob/master/HTM_CorticalLearningAlgorithms.pdf)
  to better understand the theory behind this repository.

## How
Install all code with **[IntelliJ](#install-in-linuxmacwindows-with-intellij-recommended)**
(Recommended) or **[Gradle](#install-in-linuxmacwindows-with-gradle)** for
Linux/Mac/Windows and then read **[how to contribute](#how-to-contribute)**.

#### Install in Linux/Mac/Windows with IntelliJ (Recommended)
1. If you have any problems with the following instructions please e-mail
   quinnliu@vt.edu and I will try to help the best I can. First
   make sure you have java version 1.8. To check open up a new terminal
   and type:
   ```sh
   prompt> java -version
   java version "1.8.0_60" # it's only important to see "1.8" in
                           # the version
   ```  
   If you don't have any of those Java versions install java 1.8 by going
   [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html).
   After installing java 1.8 open up a new terminal to check if java 1.8
   is installed by retyping `java -version` in the terminal.

2. Then [install IntelliJ IDEA FREE Community Edition](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/).
     - Note where you choose to install this and choose a folder that is easy to
       access (I stored it in Documents)

3. Open up IntelliJ and create a test project and get HelloWorld working.
   You will need to find your Java 1.8 jdk in the process. Once you have a program
   that can print something continue.

4. Go to the top right of this page and hit the `Fork` button. Then clone your forked wAlnut
   repository locally.

5. Inside IntelliJ, on Windows go to "File" `=>`
   "Import Project...". On Mac go to "File" `=>`
   "Project from Existing Sources...". This should open up a new window and you
   should easily be able to select the "wAlnut" folder. Click "OK".

6. Select "Import project from external model". Then select "Gradle" and hit
   "Next".

7. Select "Use default gradle wrapper (recommended)" `=>` hit Finish

8. In the left side file viewer right-click the folder "wAlnut" and select `Run 'Tests in wAlnut'`.
   Congrats! Go buy yourself some pistachio ice cream :)

#### How to contribute
1. You need to be able to use Git & Github.com. If you don't know how I created
   a easy to follow 1.5 hour playlist on how to use Git & Github
   [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44E8o-xuxWo&list=PLPXsMt57rLtgpwFBqZq4QKxrD9Hhc_8L4).  

2. For now we are using the Git workflow model described
   [here](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/wAlnut/issues/62) to contribute to this
   repository effectively. Make sure you understand this model before
   trying to merge into the master branch. Additionally, before merging your
   feature branch to master make sure to change the quote at the top of this
   README.md to another quote.

3. View our [issue tracker](https://github.com/quinnliu/WalnutiQ/issues?state=open)
   and create a new issue with a question if you are confused. Otherwise,
   assign a issue to yourself you would like to work on or suggest
   a new issue if you kinda know what you are doing.

4. While reading through the code base it will be very helpful to refer to the
   following labeled model:

#### Important brain theories in use
1. **Theory:** 1 common learning algorithm in the neocortex of the brain
   - Supportive:
     + 1992 Paper [here](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/papers/blob/master/VisualProjectionsRouted.pdf)
       from Department of Brain and
       Cognitive Sciences at MIT.
       - Summary: A portion of wires of the optic nerve are routed to the auditory
         cortex in ferrets. The neurons of this primary auditory cortex(A1) with
         vision input did not work exactly like neurons in primary visual
         cortex(V1). Neurons in rewired A1 had larger receptive field sizes
         and other differences. However there are also similarities including:
         + rewired A1 neurons showed orientation and direction selectivity.
         + similar proportions of simple, complex, and nonoriented cells between
           rewired A1 and V1.
         + implies "*significant implications for possible commonalities in
           intracortical processing circuits between sensory cortices*".

     + 1988 Paper [here](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/papers/blob/master/VisualResponses.pdf)
       from Laboratoire des Neuroscience de la Vision at Universite de Paris.
       - Summary: Wires of the optic nerve were routed permanently to the
         main thalamic somatosensory nucleus in hamsters. After the hamsters
         grew up the neurons in the somatosensory cortex were recorded.
         The "*somatosensory neurons responded to visual stimulation of
         distinct receptive fields, and their response properties resembled,
         in several characteristic features, those of normal visual cortical
         neurons.*"
         + "*the same functional categories of neurons occurred in similar
           proportions, and the neurons' selectivity for the orientation or
           direction of movement of visual stimuli was comparable*" between
           normal hamsters and rewired hamsters.
         + "*These results suggest that thalamic nuclei or cortical areas at
           corresponding levels in the visual and somatosensory pathways perform
           similar transformations on their inputs*".

   - Not supportive:
     + 2002 Paper [here](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/papers/blob/master/CorticalHeterogeneity.pdf)
       from Vision, Touch and Hearing Research Centre at The University of Queensland.
          - "*recent studies have revealed substantial variation in pyramidal
            cell structure in different cortical areas*".
          - Some of these variations like increase in dendritic arbor size(
            dendritic branching) can be resolved with the idea of a common
            algorithm.

     + 2008 PhD thesis [here](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/papers/blob/master/HowTheBrainMightWork.pdf)
       by Dileep George from Stanford University
          - "*Until we understand and explain the computational reason behind
            a large majority of such variations, the common cortical algorithm
            will have to be considered as a working hypothesis*".

   - Conclusion: If cortex X(arbitrary cortex) of the neocortex(contains visual cortex,
     auditory cortex, somatosensory cortex, and others..) can be given
     non-normal sensory input usually given to say cortex Y and then learn to
     process this new input similarily to how cortex X would process it, then we
     can hypothesize that there is a common learning/predicting algorithm in all
     cortices of the neocortex.

2. **Theory:** The 1 common learning algorithm learns about the world by using
   when things happen across time. The algorithm makes no assumptions about
   the different transformations that our world has(shifts, rotations, etc.).
   The algorithm ONLY says if 1 pattern follows another in time in a
   predictable way, then they are causally related and should have the
   SAME REPRESENTATION in the brain.
   - Kinda Supportive:
     + 2008 PhD thesis [here](https://github.com/WalnutiQ/papers/blob/master/HowTheBrainMightWork.pdf)
       by Dileep George from Stanford University
       - There is a idea in optimization algorithms called No Free Lunch
         theorem. No Free Lunch theorem "state[s] that any two optimization algorithms
         are equivalent when their performance is averaged across all possible
         problems".
       - "*On the surface, the NFL theorem seems to create problems for the
         idea of a common cortical algorithm. How can one mechanism/algorithm
         do very well on tasks as different as vision, audition and language?
         The answer comes from the part of the NFL theorem that talks about
         the assumptions that need to be exploited ... If the cortex is good
         at learning a wide variety of tasks using a common mechanism, then
         there must be something common about these seemingly different tasks.*".

   - Not supportive:

   - No Conclusion Yet: Still experimenting with rethinking a prediction algorithm
     from the ground up using ideas from temporal pooler when necessary in folder [failureResearch](./src/main/java/model/MARK_II/generalAlgorithm/failureResearch).

# Key Experiments

The following experiments show off how a general learning algorithm uses the
brain's data structure to it's advantage to process input data and create
intelligence.

The first problem a general learning algorithm has is to not get confused by
all the noise in the world. The **[noise invariance experiment](#noise-invariance-experiment)**
illustrates how the first part of the algorithm does not get confused by noisy
input data.

#### Noise invariance experiment

Here is some example code of how part of the theorized prediction algorithm
works. It is a beautiful summary of how columns of neurons in your neocortex
are probably working to encode what you see. The following are the three images
the retina will be looking at:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/WalnutiQ/artwork/master/presentations/three_images_of_digit_2.jpg)

```java
retina.seeBMPImage("2.bmp");
spatialPooler.performPooling();
// set1 = ((6,2), (1,5))
// (6,2) and (1,5) are the columns in the Region that are active after seeing
// "2.bmp"
assertEquals(set1, this.spatialPooler.getActiveColumnPositions());

retina.seeBMPImage("2_with_some_noise.bmp");
spatialPooler.performPooling();
// set1 = ((6,2), (1,5))
// NOTE: the columns that are active are still the same even though there was
//       quite a lot of noise in the input data
assertEquals(set1, this.spatialPooler.getActiveColumnPositions());

retina.seeBMPImage("2_with_a_lot_of_noise.bmp");
spatialPooler.performPooling();
// when there is a lot of noise notice how the active columns are
// no longer the same?
// set2 = ((6,2), (2,5))
assertEquals(set2, this.spatialPooler.getActiveColumnPositions());
```

You can view the entire file in
[NoiseInvarianceExperiment.java](./experiments/model/MARK_I/vision/NoiseInvarianceExperiment.java).
Please do not be afraid to ask a question if you are confused! This stuff took
me several months to fully understand but it is really beautiful after you
understand it.

## Team Bios

#### Q's bio  
Hi my name is Q.

In 2011 I watched a talk about a guy trying to build a machine more intelligent
than humans and I fell in love with this idea. At the time I believed that an
intelligent machine would be able to solve many of our hardest problems(ex.
secrets of the universe and cure for cancer) and would cause many new hard
problems(ex. massive job loss). I was determined to use it to benefit humanity
as much as possible but first I needed to build it.

I told myself I would give myself 1 year(end of 2012) to build a machine more
intelligent than humans which I believed was plenty of time since I didn’t know
how to code yet. By 2013 2 years had gone by and although I had learned a lot of
interesting brain theories from neuroscientists and coding techniques from
computer scientists I gave up on this dream out of frustration on my speed of
progress and fell into a deep depression. Most of my identity came from the
brain research I did and I had hit a wall in the research I did not have the
confidence to break through.

After focusing on my physical health, family, and friends I eventually got out
of my depression and decided to restart working towards my dream of creating a
Strong AI for the past year. However, this time I have learned to use habits
over motivation, collaboration over working alone, sustainability over crunch,
intense focus on what is necessary over nice to haves, acknowledgement you must
sometimes forget what you know in order to create something new, and many
beautiful ideas I have yet to learn.

Outside of AI I like to make YouTube videos, skateboard, watch rom coms, and
walk around manhattan eating pistachio ice cream and watermelon.
