    1) Memory = Array of unique input patterns this node has seen from it's receptive field of lower nodes during
                training_datasets. These unique patterns will be refered to as c1, c2, ...

    2) Temporal Groups = Array of multiple subsets of Memory with no overlapping subsets. Each subset temporal
                         group will be represented as g1, g2, ...
        Example:
        memory = [c1, c2, c3, c4, c5]
        temporal_group = [ {c1, c3, c5}, {c2, c4} ] where g1 = {c1, c3, c5} and g2 = {c2, c4}

        NOTE: At nodes high in the hierarchy temporal groups will begin to represent complex objects.
              After understanding model/images/explanatory/object_manifolds.png one can think of a temporal group as an
              object manifold.
